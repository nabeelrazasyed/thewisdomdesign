          <h2 class="main-heading">1. The Wisdom Design Technicalities</h2>

            <p class="main-pera">(a) Description. The The Wisdom Design Service is an online offering where individuals or entities that have signed up with The Wisdom Design as clients (each, a "Client") can post specific assignments and project descriptions, including illustrative samples or other media (each, a "Creative Brief"), revise those Creative Briefs (each, a "Revision Brief") and obtain responses (each, a "Response") to those Creative or Revision Briefs from design experts retained by The Wisdom Design ("Members"). The Wisdom Design will provide you, as the Client, the Service according to the Package you have chosen. Your Responses will be created iteratively through a drafting cycle of Creative Briefs, Revision Briefs and Responses, ultimately resulting in a final Response conforming to your various Creative and Revision Briefs.</p>
            
            <p class="main-pera">(b) Creative Brief and Responses. You are solely responsible for preparing and posting detailed descriptions of each of your Creative Briefs to the Web Site, including providing samples illustrating your Creative Brief and any relevant deadlines. For each Response to a Creative Brief that you want to receive, a term sheet (a "Term Sheet") will be generated that will contain, and be subject to, the terms and conditions you have established for the Creative or Revision Brief. The Wisdom Design is under no obligation to review a Creative or Revision Brief or Term Sheet for any purpose, including accuracy, completeness of information, quality or clarity. The Wisdom Design may decide, in its sole discretion, to deny a Creative or Revision Brief or a Term Sheet.</p>
            
            <p class="main-pera">(c) Reviewing Responses. When The Wisdom Design provides you with a Response, you are responsible for reviewing the Response. If you fail to promptly inform The Wisdom Design that the Response is not reasonably responsive to the related Term Sheet or Creative Brief, you will be deemed to have accepted the Response. If you notify The Wisdom Design that you think a response is not reasonably responsive to the related Creative Brief, you shall then submit to the Web Site a Revision Brief containing information regarding amendments or modification to be made to the initial Response. After you provide The Wisdom Design with a Revision Brief, The Wisdom Design will provide you with a subsequent Response that conforms to the additional criteria you requested. The Wisdom Design is not responsible for the content of Responses developed to the extent that such Responses are prepared to conform to your Creative or Revision Briefs.</p>
            
            <p class="main-pera">(d) Revision Cycles. Revision cycles generally consist of 2-6 additional compositions that incorporate changes you request in a Revision Brief. The purpose of the revision process is to create Responses that move your project forward in the specific direction you have determined. You may request significant changes in the first and second cycles, and the Responses generated might be quite different in nature from the original composition you selected. By the third revision request, your requests shall be modifications of the current composition only.</p>

                    <h2 class="main-heading">3. Refund, Cancellation &amp; Tax Policy</h2>
                      <p class="main-pera">In any event, any deposited funds for a project shall not be subject to refund after delivery if the initial design concepts are approved, or a change is requested unless The Wisdom Design cancels or terminates your Contract for a reason other than your breach or non-performance.</p>
                      
                      <p class="main-pera">The Wisdom Design will give your money back, in case you make a request when the initial concepts for a logo are offered. However once you approve or request changes in the initial designs, the refund offer becomes void and refund request will not be entertained. For multiple / combo packages, refund will be applicable the same as it is on the single packages. For example, if you order logo and web design service and approve the logo, you can claim refund for the website service at the time of initial design only. All refunds are subject to a minimum Administration Fee. A refund request will need to have a valid reason which must be qualified against the design brief and customer feedback for revisions. Unless a concept has not been designed according to the brief, a refund will not be given however further revisions will be provided until complete satisfaction. Money back guarantee is based on that the order is placed in good faith. Where a customer has placed design orders with more than one design agency for the same job with the intention to claim refund, we do not consider it a good faith. In such a case we reserve the right to decline a refund request. Almost all design jobs require customer feedback before finalizing the design therefore it is only fair that the customer gets involved and provides feedback in order to get the desired results. 100% unique design guarantee entitles you to a re-draw if our designed logo is to be found considerably similar to another logo design that may already exist. Any resemblance to an existing design will be merely a coincidence and The Wisdom Design will not accept any responsibility or claim of any compensation in such a case. It is the client's responsibility to get their art work copyrighted.</p>
                      
                      <p class="main-pera">An order can be cancelled 24 hours prior to the delivery date with 15% of invoice amount as cancellation charge. If you cancel your order within 24 hours of the delivery date, 25% of invoice amount as cancellation charge will apply. Cancellation requests are accepted through the email at <a href="mailto:support@thewisdomdesign.com">support@thewisdomdesign.com</a></p>
                      
                      <p class="main-pera">An account will be considered closed, if a customer does not reply us within 60 days of our communication. To reactivate an account an admin fee of $100 will be applicable.</p>
                      <p class="main-pera">Payments made by Visa, Master and Amex cards are processed by our bank merchant services. The Wisdom Design do not hold customer card details on their systems in order to provide maximum security and to remain compliant. Where recurring billing is required, card details are stored with merchant services for future payments. We also accept payments via personal/company cheque and bank transfers. Payments via PayPal &amp; Discover Card are processed by PayPal.</p>
                      
                      <p class="main-pera">All prices advertised on this website are exclusive of any applicable taxes.</p>

       <p class="main-pera">Money Back Guarantee applies to&nbsp;design packages only. Once you approve a design and ask for further revisions then the Money Back Guarantee becomes void.

     <p class="main-pera"><strong>Why do The Wisdom Design provide Money Back Guarantee?</strong></p>
       <p class="main-pera">We are so confident of our skills and design quality that we&nbsp;provide Money Back Gurantee in case we fail to deliver.&nbsp;Money Back Guarantee is provided in good faith and we expect our customers to exhibit the same. In majority of the cases customer are very honest, co-operative and provide quality feedback in order to get the designs they want. However there is a minority&nbsp;that tries to take unfair advantage of this flexibility. They will place orders with many providers at the same time, get the design concepts from all and then ask for the money back. This practice is unfair, unethical and abusive of human skills. Apologies, but if you are one of those we would rather not have your business. </p>
     <p class="main-pera">Design work is very subjective. Unless customer provides quality feedback, it is unlikely to get the designs right in the first attempt. The Wisdom Design is a custom design company that strongly believes in customer feedback and their involvement in the design process. In our experience, initial samples are rarely chosen as the final logo; instead they are used to bounce ideas. From the feedback provided on these samples we see details about the likes and dislikes of the customer and then provide revisions that are closer to the&nbsp;requirements. Money Back Guarantee cover the customers if we fail to deliver what&nbsp;they wanted. <br>
